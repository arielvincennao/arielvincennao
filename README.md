### Hi there 👋 I'm Ariel!

I'm a **curious**, **detail-oriented**, and **relentless** software developer who loves solving problems through code. I enjoy digging deep into complex challenges and transforming them into simple, elegant solutions.

💡 I believe that understanding the *why* behind the code is just as important as making it work.  
🔍 I often get "hooked" on problems — I can’t let go until I crack them.  
🔥 I don’t give up easily, and I treat every obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow.
